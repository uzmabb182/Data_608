## Gun Laws (LAWTOTAL) vs. Firearm Deaths (per100k_population_death)

-   This scatter plot will shows that states with more gun laws have lower firearm death rates.
-   The red regression line trends downward, it suggests that more gun laws lead to fewer firearm deaths.

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = LAWTOTAL, y = per100k_population_death)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.7, color = "blue") +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +  
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  
  labs(title = "More Gun Laws have Lower Firearm Death Rates",
       x = "Total Gun Laws (LAWTOTAL)",
       y = "Firearm Deaths per 100k Population")  



```
## Firearm Deaths by PERMITH (Handgun Permit Laws)

-   This compares firearm deaths in states that require a handgun permit (PERMITH = 1) vs. those that don't (PERMITH = 0).
-   PERMITH = 1 has a lower median death rate, it suggests that handgun permit laws reduce firearm deaths.

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = factor(PERMITH), y = per100k_population_death, fill = factor(PERMITH))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue"), name = "Handgun Permit") +
  labs(title = "Handgun Permit Laws Reduce Firearm Deaths",
       x = "Handgun Permit Required (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
       y = "Firearm Deaths per 100k Population")

```
## Analyzing the correlation between poverty and firearm deaths:

-   The scatter plot below shows a strong positive correlation between per100k_population_poverty and firearm deaths.
-   States with higher poverty levels tend to experience more gun-related fatalities, suggesting that economic hardship contributes to gun violence.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Check if required columns exist
required_columns <- c("per100k_populationa_death", "per100k_population_poverty")
missing_columns <- setdiff(required_columns, colnames(gun_deaths_by_demographics_df))


# Convert columns to numeric (if necessary)
#gun_deaths_by_demographics_df <- gun_deaths_by_demographics_df %>%
#  mutate(across(c(per100k_population_death, per100k_population_poverty), as.numeric))


# Create a scatter plot with trend line
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = per100k_population_poverty, y = per100k_population_death)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = per100k_population_poverty), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +  # Scatter plot points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1.2) +  # Regression line
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +  # Color scale
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  labs(title = "Firearm Deaths vs Poverty",
       subtitle = "Strong Positive Correlation between Poverty and Firearm Deaths",
       x = "Per 100K Population Poverty",
       y = "Firearm Deaths per 100K Population",
       color = "Poverty Level") +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray85"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "right"
  )


```
## The Regression Model Interpretation:

-   The regression model and scatter plots confirm that states with stricter gun laws (higher LAWTOTAL scores) tend to have lower firearm death rates.
-   States requiring handgun permits (PERMITH = 1) show fewer deaths, while states without permit requirements see higher firearm mortality.
