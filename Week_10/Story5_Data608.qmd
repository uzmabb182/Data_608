### Defining Business Question

This week we will learn to visualize models, and the next week we will learn about dimensionality reduction techniques. A good dataset to practice these tools on is the Ames housing price dataset, which is a sort of "model organism" for machine learning practice. The emphasis of this assignment (described in the pdf) is on building a model or models of the factors determining housing prices and using visualizations to explain their meaning and implications.
